## Master Branch

Please go to Master Branch to see the excel and the code

## Note

 - Since the website is dynamic and it will manipulate its data every time, the excel and data after you run the code will be different comparing with my excel. But don't worry it's normal
 * Also, the blank part under `Sales` column and `Evalutes` column means they are not shown on the website.
